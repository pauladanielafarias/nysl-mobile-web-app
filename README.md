Mobile web app for the Northside Youth Soccer League(NYSL)

This is a responsive web mobile app, so it will be seen better if it's opened in a cellphone. 
You can create a shortcut on the phone's home screen just searching the url on your cellphone navigator (Chrome, Safari, etc) and selecting the "Add a shortcut" option. 
Note that there are certain functionalities that change when your cellphone is in landscape mode. 
Remember that this is a web application, so if you refresh the page on your navigator, the app won't work without an internet connection. If you don't refresh it, it will work without internet because it will be on the cache.
